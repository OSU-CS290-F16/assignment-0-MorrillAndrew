			Most of my problems rooted from not knowing how to use GitHub. I just played with it until I knew what was going on. Finding out where the <i>upload</i> button was very benificial. It is quite confusing how I am supposed to add a link to the blog before being hosted.

			I didn't learn much at all from this assignment besides of the <i>center</i> tag, rather than using text-align, and how to link to a file ouside the directory of the current webpage. It was quite annoying how we could not go all out and throw in a little CSS, ending up with a boring black and white theme without much flexibility, like this plain text. Just going to let this text flow.

			W3Schools was the only tool I used as a reference for the <i>img</i> and the <i>center</i> tags. Otherwise, I did this based off of memory.
